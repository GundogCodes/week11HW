1.What is Express in Node.js and why is it used?
    Node is an open source server enviroment package that allows you to excecute JS 
    outside the browser.Express is backend web framework package that allows you to 
    control the node.js server enviroment with functions and methods to set/control
    a server in congruence with other node packages. You can define routes of the 
    server, process HTTP requests, create views for webpages.

2.How does Mongoose help in using MongoDB with Node.js?
    Mongoose is an Node package that allows you to control/create a database with 
    MongoDB, where you can send and retrive info/data from using its own methods
    and abilites. 
3.Can you explain the role of Mongoose in managing relationships between data?
    Mongoose is a library probably of a class with its own methods that when you 
    import into your project can allow you to run those methods (functions) on your 
    code/data. Mongoose allows you to connect to MongoDB and it's servers and create
    databases which you can read or write info/data.

4.What is a software design pattern? Give an example.
    Software Design Pattern is the process by which you organize and create a software
    application. An example is the Models Views and Controllers design patter we have
    been using in our projects. 

5.Can you explain the MVC architecture in detail?
    This design pattern seperates each of the functionalites
    into different folders. The Models folder contains the schema for the data that we 
    will use throughout the code. The Views folder holds the templates for the visuals
    that the clients can see on their device, and the Controllers define how the clients'
    HTTP requests are handled and how the views and models may or may not be impacted.

6.What roles do Model, View, and Controller play in the MVC architecture?
    The Models folder contains the schema for the data that we will use throughout the 
    code.The Views folder holds the templates for the visuals that the clients can see on 
    their device, and the Controllers define how the clients' HTTP requests are handled 
    and how the views and models may or may not be impacted.

7.Define Latency and Throughput in the context of APIs.
    Latency refers to the response time between when a query is entered and when the res
    -ponse was delivered to the client. Throughput refers to the rate at which the requests
    to the API is processed.

8.Why is it important to minimize latency and maximize throughput in APIs?
    To have our API be useful in a timely and efficient manner such that it will actually be
    valuable to the user. 

9.What is Authentication in terms of web development?
    Authentication in terms of web development lets us decern and verify that the user that the 
    requesting from our API is allowed to do so. We use the JWT package along with the schema of 
    our data to be able to create a web token that allows us to verify that the user i.
    
10.How does the authorization process start?
11.What is express.static used for in Express?
12.Can you give an example of serving static files using express.static?
13.What is Jest and why is it used?
14.How can Supertest be helpful when working with Jest?
15.Can you describe how manual and automated tests are executed?
16.What is the difference between unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing?
17.Can you provide examples of functional, regression, smoke, and performance tests?
18.What is meant by positive testing and negative testing in a functional testing context?
19.How does load testing assess the behavior of software?
20.What aspects does usability testing assess in a software application?
21.Why is security testing crucial in a software development life cycle?
22.Can you explain what compatibility testing is?
23.What is the aim of recovery testing and why is it important?
24.What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and who typically performs it?
25.Can you describe a scenario in which you would use each of the different testing types mentioned in the notes?
